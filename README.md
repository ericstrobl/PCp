# PCp

This is a MATLAB implementation of PC with p-values (PC-p). The algorithm returns edge-specific p-values for all edges in the CPDAG using order-independent skeleton discovery (as in PC-stable), v-structure orientation, and orientation rule application.

- PC_with_pval.m is the main file

- See pcp_demo.m for a demo

Coded using the Bayes Net Toolbox as a base (https://github.com/bayesnet/bnt).
